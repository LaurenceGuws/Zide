# VT Core Design

Date: 2026-03-10

Purpose: define the exact ownership split for the next terminal-core redesign
lane so code changes do not drift between "session cleanup", "FFI cleanup", and
"embed-friendly cleanup".

This doc is the concrete follow-up to:

- `app_architecture/review/TERMINAL_CORE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026-03-10.md`
- `app_architecture/terminal/vt_core_rearchitecture_todo.yaml`

## Main Goal

Turn Zide's terminal backend into a real embeddable VT engine with:

- a pure terminal emulation core
- a first-class FFI boundary
- transport-agnostic host integration
- renderer-agnostic snapshots and damage

Desktop PTY-backed Zide remains a supported host, but it must stop defining the
architectural center.

## Target Types

### 1. `TerminalCore`

This becomes the engine-owned center.

It owns:

- parser state
- protocol execution
- primary/alt screens
- history/scrollback
- selection semantics
- terminal modes
- OSC/CSI/DCS/APC state
- kitty graphics state
- title/cwd/semantic prompt/backend metadata that belongs to terminal semantics
- damage generation
- snapshot generation

It does not own:

- PTY
- host threads
- workspace tabs
- SDL/widget/render state
- process lifecycle policy

Expected direction:

- `src/terminal/core/terminal_session.zig` stops being the owner of the above
- the future public engine center should live under `src/terminal/core/` or
  `src/terminal/engine/`

### 2. `TerminalTransport`

This is the byte-stream boundary around the core.

It owns host-specific delivery of:

- input bytes into the terminal
- output bytes from the host side into the core
- resize notifications
- host lifecycle/wakeup integration

There should be multiple implementations:

- PTY transport
- external transport adapter
- test/replay transport

This is the key requirement for:

- Flutter hosts
- mobile SSH-backed sessions
- non-PTY embedded environments

`TerminalTransport` should not own terminal semantics. It only moves bytes and
host signals.

### 3. `PtyTerminalSession`

This is the desktop-host runtime wrapper.

It owns:

- PTY creation/start/stop
- read/write pumping
- child exit observation
- optional threads
- host polling and pressure hints

It wraps:

- `TerminalCore`
- one PTY transport implementation

This is the likely future role of today's `TerminalSession`.

### 4. `TerminalSnapshot`

This remains renderer-agnostic and becomes more explicitly core-owned.

It should expose:

- rows/cols
- flat cell state
- cursor state
- damage summary
- title/cwd metadata needed by hosts
- selection state needed by hosts/renderers
- kitty image placement metadata needed by renderers

The snapshot contract should be valid for:

- SDL/OpenGL renderer
- Flutter renderer
- FFI consumers
- replay/test tooling

### 5. `TerminalInputEncoder`

This remains a peer subsystem.

It consumes:

- terminal mode state
- key/mouse/text events

It emits:

- encoded terminal input bytes

It should be usable:

- from PTY-backed desktop hosts
- from FFI hosts
- without pulling in session/runtime code

## Ownership Map

### Core-owned behavior

These behaviors must move toward `TerminalCore` ownership:

- parser feed
- protocol dispatch
- screen mutation
- history/scrollback mutation
- selection mutation semantics
- alt-screen behavior
- terminal mode state
- protocol-triggered title/cwd/clipboard metadata
- kitty graphics protocol state
- snapshot generation

### Host/runtime-owned behavior

These must stay outside the core:

- PTY open/start/stop
- thread creation
- child process shutdown
- desktop polling cadence
- workspace tab management
- SDL widget gesture orchestration
- GPU upload policy

### Shared boundary behavior

These must be explicit contracts:

- feed terminal output bytes into the core
- request encoded input bytes from host events
- consume snapshots and damage
- drain host-visible events
- resize core state

## Event Model

The core should own a narrow event queue for host-visible state changes.

Candidate core-visible events:

- title changed
- cwd changed
- clipboard write request
- bell
- child exit observed by host wrapper
- wake/dirty

Important distinction:

- `bell`, `title`, `cwd`, `clipboard` are terminal/core-facing semantics
- `child exit` is host/runtime-facing and may be injected into the same exported
  event stream by a host wrapper

## FFI Direction

The current `zide_terminal_ffi.h` surface is still effectively session-backed.

Future shape:

### Core-facing operations

- create/destroy core-backed handle
- feed output bytes
- resize
- encode/send key/mouse/text
- snapshot acquire/release
- scrollback acquire/release
- event drain/free
- state getters

### Optional host/runtime operations

- create PTY-backed host session
- start child
- poll runtime
- query child exit

This should become two layers in the API model even if they are initially
exported from one shared library:

- core API
- optional PTY host API

That keeps Flutter and mobile consumers from depending on PTY/session semantics
they do not need.

## Compatibility Strategy

We do not go from zero to hero in one patch.

Migration approach:

1. define `TerminalCore` contract in docs
2. introduce a new internal core type without changing behavior
3. make current `TerminalSession` wrap that core
4. move protocol execution and state ownership onto the core
5. move FFI to target the core boundary first
6. keep PTY-backed desktop behavior working through the wrapper

## Progress

### 2026-03-10 first code cut

The first `VTCORE-01` extraction is now landed internally:

- `src/terminal/core/terminal_core.zig` owns the engine-centered terminal state
- `TerminalSession` now wraps `core: TerminalCore`
- PTY/runtime/thread/render-publication ownership stays in `TerminalSession` for now

This first cut moved these owners under `TerminalCore` without changing behavior:

- primary/alt screens and active-screen state
- history/scrollback
- parser state
- OSC title/cwd/clipboard/hyperlink state
- semantic prompt and user vars
- kitty image state
- palette/default-color state
- saved charset and clear-generation state

This is intentionally not the end-state. Protocol execution and FFI still route
through `TerminalSession`, but they now do so against a real internal core owner
instead of one flat session struct.

### 2026-03-10 protocol split follow-up

The next extraction-only step moved pure engine-side protocol helpers behind
`src/terminal/core/terminal_core_protocol.zig`.

This module currently owns the protocol behaviors that are already clearly
core/model-centered:

- screen erase/insert/delete helpers
- palette lookups
- core cursor and cell queries
- cursor style changes
- tab-stop-at-cursor
- DECRQSS reply formatting that only depends on core state

`session_protocol.zig` now remains focused on the still session-coupled pieces:

- parser feed/dispatch entrypoints
- alt-screen transitions
- selection/cache invalidation coordination
- runtime-facing protocol side effects

### 2026-03-10 dispatch split follow-up

Parser/control dispatch ownership is now partially split again:

- `src/terminal/core/terminal_core_dispatch.zig` owns control, CSI, OSC, APC,
  DCS, codepoint, and ASCII dispatch entry helpers
- `session_protocol.zig` now keeps the session-coupled pieces that still depend
  on session-owned locking and publication

The main remaining reason parser feed still lives in `session_protocol.zig` is
that byte feed currently owns:

- state mutex acquisition
- output generation increments
- view-cache publication updates

That is the next real boundary to cleanly separate if we want parser feed to
become fully core-owned.

### 2026-03-10 feed split follow-up

Parser byte feed is now split one step further:

- `src/terminal/core/terminal_core_feed.zig` owns the actual parser feed call
- `session_protocol.zig` now only wraps that feed with:
  - state mutex ownership
  - output generation publication
  - view-cache refresh publication

This makes the remaining session-owned part of parser feed explicit: it is not
parsing anymore, it is publication choreography.

### 2026-03-10 first transport contract

The first internal `TerminalTransport` contract is now landed in
`src/terminal/core/terminal_transport.zig`.

Current scope:

- PTY open/start wiring
- transport resize delivery
- has-data checks
- child-exit polling
- aliveness checks
- foreground-process label and close-confirm metadata
- transport deinit

Current PTY-backed runtime code now consumes that contract in:

- `session_runtime.zig`
- `resize_reflow.zig`
- `session_queries.zig`

This is intentionally not the final transport split yet. The byte pumps and
writer path still reach the PTY field directly, but host lifecycle and metadata
no longer have to.

## Immediate Naming Direction

These names are recommended to avoid ambiguity:

- `TerminalCore`
- `TerminalCoreSnapshot`
- `TerminalCoreEvent`
- `TerminalTransport`
- `PtyTerminalSession`

Avoid continuing to use `TerminalSession` as the name of the engine center once
the new boundary exists.

## Non-goals

- no Flutter-specific rendering API
- no renderer rewrite in this lane
- no protocol behavior change just to fit the new names
- no broad workspace/UI redesign mixed into the core move

## First Code-Cut Intent

The first implementation slice should be:

- introduce a new internal `TerminalCore` owner
- move no UI behavior
- keep current PTY-backed session behavior identical
- leave FFI surface stable for that slice

That gives the redesign a real center without forcing a full bridge rewrite in
the same patch.
